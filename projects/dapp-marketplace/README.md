# DApp Marketplace (Solidity + Web Frontend)

Coursework mini-project for the **Mobile and Wireless Communications Security** syllabus.
Implements a simple on-chain marketplace smart contract and a minimal web UI to interact with it.

## Contents
- `marketplace.sol` — marketplace smart contract (list/buy items).
- `index.html` + `app.js` — lightweight frontend for contract interaction.
- `DApp_marketplace.pdf` — report

## How to demo (quick)
1. Deploy `marketplace.sol` in Remix (Solidity 0.8.x).
2. Copy the deployed contract address and ABI into `app.js` (placeholders inside).
3. Open `index.html` in a browser (or with a simple local server) and interact via a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

## Notes
Educational project; not audited or production-ready.
